# rest-dbus

rest-dbus was a [dfeet](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DFeet)-like UI over HTTP
written for OpenBMC.  It is no longer maintained and depends on Python 2, so
you should probably not use it.  A port to the
[bmcweb](https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb) project implemented the same REST
APIs as rest-dbus, but browser side support remains unimplemented.
